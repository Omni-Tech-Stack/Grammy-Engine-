## 💡 Prompt Engineering Tips

Based on these examples, effective prompts include:

### ✅ Do Include:

- **Use case** - Intended purpose (e.g., "for studying", "movie trailer")
- **Reference points** - Similar artists or tracks (e.g., "like Kygo")

### ❌ Avoid:
- Overly vague descriptions (e.g., "good music")
- Conflicting requirements (e.g., "relaxing and energetic")
- Too many genres mixed (pick 1-2 main genres)
- Unrealistic expectations (e.g., "sounds exactly like The Beatles")

### 🎯 Example Prompt Template:

```
"[Genre] track with [specific instruments], [BPM] BPM, 
[key mood/emotion], perfect for [use case],
