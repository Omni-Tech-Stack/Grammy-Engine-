## 🎤 Full Lyrics

```
[Intro - Instrumental]
(Ocean waves, tropical percussion, rising synth pad)

[Verse 1]
Waves are crashing on the golden shore
Feel the rhythm that we've been searching for
Palm trees swaying in the summer breeze
This is where we're meant to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Close your eyes and feel the sun
Our paradise has just begun

[Chorus]
Sunset paradise, dancing through the night
Feel the ocean's heartbeat, everything's alright
Golden skies above, freedom in the air
Sunset paradise, we haven't got a care

[Verse 2]
Colors painting across the endless sky
Let the moment take us, you and I
Feel the sand between our toes tonight
Everything just feels so right

[Pre-Chorus]
Close your eyes and feel the sun
Our paradise has just begun

[Chorus]
Sunset paradise, dancing through the night
Feel the ocean's heartbeat, everything's alright
Golden skies above, freedom in the air
Sunset paradise, we haven't got a care

[Bridge]
(Breakdown - minimal percussion, ambient pads)
Let the world fade away
We're living for today
In this moment we'll stay
In our sunset paradise

[Final Chorus]
Sunset paradise, dancing through the night
Feel the ocean's heartbeat, everything's alright
Golden skies above, freedom in the air
Sunset paradise, we haven't got a care

[Outro]
(Fade out with ocean waves, steel drums, and synth pads)
Sunset paradise... (we haven't got a care)
Sunset paradise... (we'll always find it there)
```
